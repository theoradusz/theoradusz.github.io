# Hello from Tokyo!
I'm Th√©o, a machine learning engineer based in Japan, but I first came to the world in 1998's Paris.

Recently, I spend my days building algorithms and cloud infrastructure at [WOTA](https://wota.co.jp/), where we are aiming to solve water issues by making small and autonomous water reuse systems! 

During my work days I am busy developing statistical models, especially **bayesian models**, in order to make water recycling systems smarter and safer. I find it very satisfying to watch code and equations become actions once deployed in the real world! When not in a coffee break, I also enjoy reading papers to look for new approaches to try.

On the evenings and weekends, I like to go and discover Tokyo (every neighborhood is a village), think about optimizing **language learning** (especially japanese) or listen to **prog music**. I will try to [collect some random things](https://radusz.com/collection) I like.

If you ever want to discuss statistics, water treatment, science-fiction, philosophy or Steven Wilson' latest album, you can reach me at theo@radusz.com!
