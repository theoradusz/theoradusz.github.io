# Hello, welcome to my page!
My name is Th√©o, I live in Japan and was born in Paris (France) in the nineties.

I am a **machine learning engineer** building algorithms and cloud infrastructure to try and make **water recycling systems** smarter, safer and more efficient.
I work at [WOTA](https://wota.co.jp/), a Tokyo-based start-up. We are building small-scale water reuse systems, aiming at tackling global water issues. Here is my resume.

At work I enjoy:
- statistical modelling, especially making **Bayesian models** 
- learning from academic research and quickly testing new approaches
- watching systems in action and how software acts on the real world
- coffee breaks


Outside of work, I am interested in many things including:
- language learning, especially **japanese**
- reading books, looking at art, listening to prog music
- go for walks in the neighborhood

Please find some random things I appreciate in my [collection](https://radusz.com/collection).
